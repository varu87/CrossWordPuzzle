									CROSS WORD PUZZLE
									====================

Objectives and features
-----------------------------
1. The application combines the feature of the famous Crossword and the touch based Word puzzle. 
2. On page load, a 10X10 grid of random letters will be displayed alongwith a list of clues. 
3. The clues are the actual meaning of the words hidden in the puzzle. The words and meanings come from an external Dictionary file.
3. The word may be arranged in the correct or opposite order vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
4. Once the word is located, click and drag over the word. This will draw a rectangle with curved edges around the word. If the selection is correct, the corresponding clue will be striked off.

Application Files
---------------------
The application uses the HTML5 canvas to generate the grid and draw the rectangular selector. A WCF service, invoked from the HTML file, is used to generate the puzzle and clue list.
The application has three projects:
1. Dictionary: This reads the external dictionary file and convert it to a Dictionary object that is later used to create the grid.
2. RandomArrayProject: This selects a random list of words from the dictionary and arranges the same in the puzzle arbitrarily.
3. WordPuzzleService: The WCF service used to get the actual puzzle grid and the clue list from the dictionary.

Deployment Steps
-----------------------
1. First the Dictionary, RandomArrayProject and WordPuzzleService needs to be built in that order. 
2. Create a web site in IIS and publish the service in the virtual directory created for the site.
3. The following files should be added to the virtual directory as well:
     a) index.html
     b) Dictionary.xml
     c) WordPuzzle.js
     d) WordPuzzle.css
     e) jQuery.js
     f) kinetic.js
4. Please make sure the service URL in the HTML corresponds to the actual URL of the service hosted locally.
